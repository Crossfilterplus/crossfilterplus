# crossfilterplus
Wrapper over crossfilter to manipulate data easily. It is developer friendly in nature.
**Crossfilterplus** is a npm module for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser in a config driven manner. Since it is built over crossfilter, it could supports extremely fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing a million or more records; we built it to power analytics for Square Register, allowing merchants to slice and dice their payment history fluidly.
